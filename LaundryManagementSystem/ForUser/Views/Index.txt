            We present the design and implementation of a laundry management system (LMS) used in a laundry establishment. Laundry firms are usually faced with difficulties in keeping detailed records of customers clothing; this little problem as seen to most laundry firms is highly discouraging as customers are filled with disappointments, arising from issues such as customer clothes mix-ups and untimely retrieval of clothes. The aim of this application is to determine the number of clothes collected, in relation to their owners, as this also helps the users fix a date for the collection of their clothes. Also customer's information is secured, as a specific id is allocated per registration to avoid contrasting information.

            Laundry services system is a system that manages services for consumers, especially customers who have signed up as members. With this system a good cleaning service, it will ensure the availability of needed services to consumers. Due to the many cleaning services system as manual that affects waste or inefficiency of time, data inaccuracies, errors repeated so the writer tries to computerized valet service process in the hope of providing data or information fast, precise, accurate and efficient.

            Today’s modernization flow of the world has witnessed tremendous change in lifestyle of the society. Computerized system in managing laundry has been well accepted especially in developing countries. This service is well accepted because it gives flexibility in terms of time for laundry management team to use it and this really helps them with their time management. Laundry firms currently use a manual system for the management and maintenance of critical information. The current system requires numerous paper forms, with data stores spread throughout the laundry management infrastructure. Often information (on forms) is incomplete or does not follow management standards. Records are often lost in transit during computation requiring a comprehensive auditing process to ensure that no vital information is lost. Multiple copies of the same information exist in the laundry firm data and may lead to inconsistencies in data in various data stores.
